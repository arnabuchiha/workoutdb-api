# üèãÔ∏è WorkoutDB API

A high-performance, open-source API for managing workouts, muscle activations, equipment, and body parts. Built for developers, trainers, and fitness platforms that want to build powerful, flexible, and cost-effective exercise recommendation systems.

This API powers smart workout search, alternative exercise suggestions based on actual muscle activation data, and lets you manage detailed fitness metadata across exercises.

Website: [WorkoutDB API](https://workoutdb.is-app.in)

## üì¶ **Data Model**

The API includes endpoints for:

- **Workouts**: with names, instructions, muscles, equipment, and YouTube demos
- **Muscles**: including grouped muscle codes and activation levels
- **Muscle Activations**: scientifically grounded values (0.0‚Äì1.0)
- **Equipment** and **Body Parts** metadata
- **Smart Alternatives**: Get similar workouts based on activation profiles

Muscle activation values are grounded in biomechanical and sports science literature. They're used to compare and recommend exercises based on how much a particular muscle is engaged.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Tech Stack**

WorkoutDB is optimized for performance and affordability using a modern serverless stack:

- **Backend**: [Hono](https://hono.dev) (fast, minimal web framework)
- **Runtime**: [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) (ultra-fast global edge compute via V8 isolates)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (type-safe database access)
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) PostgreSQL (hosted with relational schema)
- **Infrastructure**: [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for deploying to Cloudflare
- **Environment**: Built with TypeScript, ESM-first, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for linting and formatting

This stack allows API calls to return in **milliseconds**, even under load, while keeping infra **costs low**.

## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To get started with WorkoutDB locally:

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workout-db-api.git
cd workout-db-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory and fill in the following:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
BETTER_AUTH_URL=
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECT_URL=
VERSION=
ENVIRONMENT=development
API_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_KEY=
RAPID_API_SECRET=
ADMIN_KEY=
```

### 4. Start the Dev Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

This uses Cloudflare Workers + Wrangler to run the project locally.

### 5. Database Setup

Use the Drizzle ORM CLI to manage your database:

```bash
bun run db:push   # Apply schema
bun run db:pull   # Sync with remote
```
